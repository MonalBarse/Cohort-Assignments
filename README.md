# 100xdevs Cohort

> This GitHub repository serves as a record for tracking assignments and their respective solutions within the 100xdevs cohort, focusing on full-stack web development.
> I intend to regularly update this repository with new assignments and their solutions. This allows me to review and revisit the problems in the assignments, maintaining an organized record of my progress and ensuring that I stay informed about my current level of proficiency.
